# Foreward

This book is a bit of an experiment in itself. Rather than simply writing documentation
in the form of docstrings with some extra files here and there, I thought it would be
interesting to try to write in a longer format on how I go about things. Scientific
publications are great, but I thought it would be nice to have a reference for myself 
to look back over the entire development and experiment process. Methods sections only go so far,
and there are likely a lot of steps that I will forget if I don't write them down.

I hope that this book can catalog my process of working with supercomputers. Supercomputing
is not an area that is not often taught at universities, so the old hands learn a lot of 
tricks along the way.
